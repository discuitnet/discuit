# Discuit

This is the codebase that powers [Discuit](https://discuit.net), which is an
open-source community platform, an alternative to Reddit.

Built with:

- [Go](https://go.dev): The backend.
- [React](https://react.dev/): The frontend.
- [MariaDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB): The main datastore.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/): For transient data.

## Getting started

### Running locally

To setup a development environment of Discuit on your local computer:

1.  Install Go (1.21 or higher) by following the instructions at
    [go.dev.](https://go.dev/doc/install)
1.  Install MariaDB, Redis, Node.js (and NPM). On Ubuntu, for instance, you might
    have to run the following commands:

    ```shell
    sudo apt update

    # Install and start MariaDB
    sudo apt install mariadb-server
    sudo systemctl start mariadb.service

    # Install and start Redis
    sudo apt install redis-server
    sudo systemctl start redis.service

    # Install Node.js and NPM
    sudo apt install nodejs npm
    ```

1.  Create a MariaDB database.

    ```shell
    # Open MariaDB CLI
    mariadb -u root -p --binary-as-hex

    # Create a database named discuit (you may use a different name)
    create database discuit;

    # Enter exit (or press Ctrl+D) to exit
    exit;
    ```

1.  Discuit uses `libvips` for fast image transformations. Make sure it's
    installed on your computer. On Ubuntu you can install it with:
    `shell
sudo apt install libvips
`
1.  Clone this repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/discuitnet/discuit.git && cd discuit
    ```
1.  Create a file named `config.yaml` in the root directory and copy the contents
    of `config.default.yaml` into it. And enter the required config parameters in
    `config.yaml`.
1.  Build the frontend and the backend:
    ```shell
    ./build.sh
    ```
1.  Run migrations:
    ```shell
    ./discuit -migrate
    ```
1.  Start the server:
    ```shell
    ./discuit -serve
    ```

After creating an account, you can run `./discuit -make-admin username` to make
a user an admin of the site.

Note: Do not install the `discuit` binary using `go install` or move it somewhere
else. It uses files in this repository at runtime and so it should only be run
from the root of this repository.

### Source code layout

In the root directory are these directories:

- `core`: Contains all the core functionality of the backend.
- `internal`: Contains Go packages internal to the project.
- `migrations`: Contains the SQL migration files.
- `server`: Contains the REST API backend.
- `ui` - Contains the React frontend.
