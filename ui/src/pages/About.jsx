      answer: `
        We do not know if all types of social platforms can have their non-profit
        alternatives—a non-profit alternative to Youtube probably won’t work, as
        hosting video is highly expensive—but we’re quite confident that Discuit can
        scale into millions of users just fine as a non-profit.  Hosting text is
        extremely cheap; images are not too costly either; it’s video that is
        expensive, and Discuit does not, nor do we plan to, have native video uploads.

            federation in the future either. This is because we do not believe that

            mainstream social platforms one day.`}

              Our mission is to build the first large-scale social media platform where the
              interests of the platform are aligned with the interests of the user—a platform, in
              other words, that’s built on principles of ethical design. At the heart of these
              principles is the idea of giving users the freedom to choose their online social
              experience as they would prefer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Social media platforms have hitherto done the opposite and taken away what little
              control the users had, as it served those companies’ own self-interest, which was and
              still remains, to make as much money as possible, without any regard for, indeed to
              the utter detriment of, the well-being of the user.
