# Discuit Docs

One thing about product design: Defaults that cater to the majority, with tons 
of options for users who would use them to customize their experience.

## Roadmap

The following lists (except the last one) are loosely ordered by importance. 

### Main milestones (next)

- [x] User created communities.

	- [ ] Choose which notifications to get.
	- [ ] Set the Home page to one of Subscriptions page or All Posts page.
	- [ ] Select font-size.
	- [ ] Enable or disable thumbnails (including community and user profile icons).
    - [ ] Change default feed sorting.
- Filtering:
	- [ ] Filter out posts from certain communities on Home (which is our /r/all).
	- [ ] Filter posts by topic (sports, music, movies, news, etc).
	- [ ] An explore page (modeled after Youtube's Home page).
    - [ ] Filter link-posts by URL or domain.
- For moderators:
	- [ ] Pinned posts and comments.
	- [ ] Lock individual comments (so they cannot be replied to).
	- [ ] A single page for handling reports for users who moderate multiple 
      communities. 
	- [ ] Temporary bans.

- [ ] Wiki pages for communities.

### Minor improvements (that collectively would add up to a lot)

- [ ] Comment permalink.
- [ ] User profile pictures (with the option to disable them).
- [ ] Publicly show last seen on profile (do it like Goodreads, only showing the 
  last month the user was active in).
- [ ] Log when a user joins/leaves a community (for keeping track of how long 
  someone's been a member of a community).
- [ ] Option for moderators to hide vote count until x minutes.
- [ ] Hover username / community name info box.
- [ ] No downvotes until reaching x points in community: An anti-brigading 
  feature. Helps a community keep its culture.
- [ ] Post page sidebar recommendations (with the option to disable them).
- [X] User badges (displayed on profile page).
- [ ] Subscribe to a post to get notifications.
- [ ] Post drafts.
- [ ] History (viewed posts).
- [ ] Highlight new comments of a post since you last visited it.
- [ ] Post and comment (editing) preview.
- [ ] Colors for comment indent lines.
- [ ] 'Collapse' button next to 'Reply' button for comments (like on Substack and 
  Hacker News).
- [ ] User profile: View comments and posts seperately.
- [ ] Full screen image view.
- [ ] Option to open post in large modal instead of going to page.
- [ ] View post's and comments one has upvoted.
- [ ] Something like Reddit's flairs to group posts within a community.

## To think about

- Make community display name distinct from its handle name.
- Keyboard shortcuts.
- Filter comments by OP, Mod, Admin, or some particular user.
- Comments embedded plugin for third-party websites (like Disqus).
- Media tab (also Twitter style photos grid in sidebar).
- Image replies (good for meme communities; off by default).
- View top posts within a specific time window (go back in history).
    - View top posts in a given day (like on Hacker News).
- Ways to restrict users for serious discussions (how to
  keep the idiots, zealots, and children out).
    - Have a quick, 5 mins test to join a community.
    - Demote short comments.
    - Have well known members ("Member for x years.", etc)
    - Flagging system like on Hacker News.
    - Disabling voting (or vote counters) altogether.
- Karma tracking per community: user x has y points from z community. To track 
  well known members.
- Top comments page.
- "Appreciate" button (with a counter) on user profile (a metric of only 
  positive values).
- No of users online in home page and community page.
- A way for users to boot mods collectively (by a popular vote, say).
- Point system (on user profiles) should end. Solely, to get rid karma farmers.
- Ability to filter different kinds of content.
    - All content.
    - Text & link posts only.
    - Image posts only.
    - By category: technology, news, sports, etc.
    - Filter out specific communities.
    - Memes only.
    - Without memes.
    - By country or region.
- Controversial ratio on profile (total upvotes:downvotes on user's posts and 
  comments).

## Important (perhaps unsolvable) problems

- The fluff principle: posts (and comments) that are the easiest to upvote 
  (judge) will rise to the top.
- Most top comments would be early comments.
